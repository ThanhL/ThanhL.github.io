							<p>For the makeathon, we were tasked to help a gentleman named Steve who had trouble accessing the content of his bag (which was located in the rear of the wheelchair), as it would require him to twist around the back of his wheelchair. This prove to be difficult when the contents bag became heavy in activities such as grocery shopping. A customised motorised “arm” was agreed upon that would transport the contents of his bag at the rear, to the side making it more accessible. 
							</p>
							<p>The experience was a amazing and intense 3 days, with everyone working really hard trying to assemble the powered mechanical system. In the last day, we managed to assemble a functioning arm that delivered the contents of the bag from the rear to the side for Steve. We’ve encountered some power issues for the motor towards the end of the makeathon, so we are planning finish off the system outside of the event.</p>
